## Project Name: _A Dance of Fire and Ice_

### Date: _11/21/24_

## 1. **Task/Problem Description**

I am currently working on creating a game on python pygame where the mechanics are inspired by the real A Dance of Fire and Ice game.

---

## 2. **Initial Approach/Code**

My intial approach were to make a rhythm game where the player has to press space bar at the correct timing to proceed and the beats are song based.

## 3. **Interaction with ChatGPT**

### Questions/Requests to ChatGPT

How do I create an ball orbiting another stationary ball in python?

## 4. **ChatGPT's Suggestions/Code Changes**

To create a ball orbiting another stationary ball in Python using the pygame library, we can use basic trigonometry to calculate the position of the orbiting ball. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create this effect:
Concept
Stationary Ball: A ball that stays in one place.
Orbiting Ball: A ball that moves in a circular path around the stationary ball.
Trigonometry: We use the sin and cos functions to calculate the position of the orbiting ball relative to the center (stationary ball) in a circular orbit.
Steps:
Set up Pygame: Initialize the Pygame library and set up the screen and other basic configurations.
Create the Stationary Ball: Draw the stationary ball at a fixed position.
Orbit Calculation: Use math.cos() and math.sin() to calculate the position of the orbiting ball over time.
Update the Position: Continuously update the orbiting ballâ€™s position based on the time passed (this creates smooth movement).
Draw Both Balls: Continuously update the display.

## 5. **Reflection on Changes**

ChatGPT utlized more efficient codes and algorithm which reduced my original code by a few lines.

---

## 6. **Testing and Results**

After changing my code according to ChatGPT's suggestions, I found bugs where the player was able to spam for the win.

- Did the code work as expected after incorporating ChatGPT's changes?
Not really, ChatGPT sometimes doesn't understand what it was supposed to do and assume which creates unexpected results that could be good or bad

- Did you encounter any bugs or issues during testing?
Yes, there were bugs where the player was able to spam in order to gain scores

## 7. **What Did You Learn?**

I learned the flexibility of coding and the ability to utilize ChatGPT as a useful tool to help me reach my goals.
